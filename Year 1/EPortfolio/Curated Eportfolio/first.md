The first learning objective that I have been working towards in my first year of my degree is the objective “Fundamental knowledge of the theoretical underpinnings of computer science”. This learning objective requires me to understand the core concepts and values behind computer science and what drives the computer science industry: learning these objectives are key for both employ ability as well as the success of anyone wanting to become successful in this industry. The learning objective means that we need to achieve the understanding of these core concepts. Examples of these core concepts include: insert here. It’s rather difficult to put these key concepts into words due to the very nature of being a concept/underpinning. I feel I have completed this learning outcome within the Software design module: within this module we’ve learned a lot about design and the development cycle that goes into software design: I believe that this helps to represent a fundamental underpinning of computer science as this development flow is used in every type of development, even if people aren’t aware that they’re doing it. In order to evidence this, I will provide a snapshot: originally recorded from a seminar homework activity that meets this learning objective.
