Another objective that I’ve been working hard on is the recognition of the need for adaptable approaches to problem solving. This objective means that we need to come up with solutions in order to work around a problem that we’re given: problems often occur within programming and this means that I come up with ways around that specific problem and do research in order to solve a problem. I have met this multiple times: one of the first times I ever came across this problem was when I had to write lines from a file in a specific format and then use these lines in order to display on screen: with lines being formatted to contain separate information, I had to work out what the current line actually represented: in order to do this I detected what the line number was and then divided it by 3, using the remainder to find out what the specific line represents. Meaning I can display information.As seen by the digital evidence below, from PPW2 task 2:
