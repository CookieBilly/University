The third learning objective that I was asked to complete was the appraisal  of  the  fundamental  operation  of  computer  systems,  network  architectures,  hardware components, operating systems and associated protocols and data structures. This represents the hardware component of the module: it requires that we understand how computers work and how we can perform maintenance and build a computer for a client or ourselves. It requires that we understand how networks interface and interact with each other as well as understanding operating systems and the data structures that help them to function (for example binary and hexadecimal). It’s important that these are understood as they allow for development in computing as well as further understanding when developing programs.I believe I have met this objective as I fundamentally understand the operation of computer systems and hardware components: This can be demonstrated by looking at PPW1: in which I created a computer build for a customer and provided reasoning for choosing each component, this has allowed me to gain a crucial understanding of the workings of computers. The evidence for this can be seen below, from PPW1 task 3:
